# Development Guide

## Project Overview

Pandas Pick & Roll is an NBA fantasy basketball analytics dashboard designed to help fantasy managers identify waiver wire pickups and streaming opportunities.

The project uses NBA data to calculate fantasy-relevant insights including:
- Schedule advantages
- Player trends
- Minutes opportunities
- Streaming scores

# Coding Standards

## Python Style

Follow these conventions:

- Use descriptive variable names.
- Avoid generic names like `df` outside of quick exploration.
- Use type hints for functions.
- Add docstrings to functions.
- Keep scripts focused on one responsibility.

## Data Modeling Principles

The project separates:

- Human-readable classifications (e.g., `SCHEDULE_RATING`)
- Numeric scores (future `SCHEDULE_SCORE`)
- Composite analytics (future `STREAMING_SCORE`)

## Development Workflow

For each new feature:

1. Write the transformation.
2. Verify with temporary print statements.
3. Validate the output.
4. Remove temporary debugging output.
5. Save the processed dataset.
---

# Data Processing Standards

- Convert date columns to `datetime64` before performing any date calculations.
- Assign each game to a fantasy week using the Monday of that week (`WEEK_START`).
- Validate each transformation with temporary print statements, then remove them once verified.

# DataFrame Naming

DataFrames should describe the data they contain.

## Examples:

### Good:

```
players
team_game_logs
weekly_schedule
streaming_scores
```
### AVOID:
```
df
data
temp
```
---

# Functions

Functions should include:

* A descriptive name
* Type hints
* A docstring

Example:

```python
def get_opponent(matchup: str) -> str:
    """
    Extract opponent team abbreviation.

    Args:
        matchup: NBA matchup string.

    Returns:
        Opponent team abbreviation.
    """
```

# Data Pipeline Philosophy

 The project follows this structure:

```
Data Collection
        ↓
Raw Data
        ↓
Data Processing
        ↓
Feature Engineering
        ↓
Weekly Schedule Analytics
        ↓
Streaming Score (Coming Soon)        
        ↓
Power BI Dashboard
```

# Git Workflow

Commits should describe meaningful changes.

### Examples:

Good:

```
Add NBA schedule data collection

Create Weekly schedule analysis

Refactor file paths using pathlib
```

Avoid:
```
Update stuff

Fix code

Changes
```

# DEV DIARY

## Day 2: Weekly Schedule Analytics Pipeline

Completed:
- Built NBA schedule data collection pipeline
- Created raw and processed data structure
- Added weekly schedule calculations
- Added schedule strength ratings
- Improved script organization
- Connected project to GitHub
- Established main branch workflow

Git concepts learned:
- Feature branches
- Remote repositories
- Push/pull workflow
- Branch merging
- Default branch management

## Day 3: Per-Team Rest Day Analysis

- Introduced a new utils/path.py script.
  - Streamlined the usage of file paths by consolidating project root directories.
- Practiced clear data organization by differentiating between "DAYS_BETWEEN_GAMES" and "REST_DAYS"
- FINALLY stopped saving every intermediate output to be more efficient with our space.
  - Intermediate outputs are also very easily replicable.
